## The idea with the program

The program will be a rather simple cardgame named "Bismarck". The game has many other names as well for example, "paska housu", "Chinahand" and surely many more. The rules will be layed out in greater detail in the "Rules" section. The idea is to create a digital version of this classic cardgame using a peer-to-peer network as the ground on which players can play online. In the future the game might be upgraded to a true server, but for simplicity's sake and due to time constraints this version will only work peer-to-peer. 


## Users

To begin with the game will only have "normal users". In the future, if the game will move truly online and statistics about games would be uploaded there might be need for some sort of an administrator who could access the statistics. But to begin with there will only be "normal users".

## The set up

The program consists of six different "landscapes". (Landscape = a menu or game page).
Landscape 1 will consist of a log in screen where the user will have to either "log in - entering a username and a password connected to an account" or "create an account". These two alternatives would lead to landscape 2 or 3. 
If the user chose "create an account" it would take him/her to landscape 2 which consists of three input lines and a finish button. The first input let's the user create a username and the second lets the user create a password. The third asks the user to reenter the password. When the user has entered the three input lines he/she can continue to landscape 3 by pressing the finish button below. 

Landscape 3 consists of the "main menu"-page. Here the user can press four different buttons. Button 1 (Play Game) Let's the player connect to a peer-to-peer server and play against a friend. This is takes the player to landscape 4. Button 2 (Rules) on landscape 3 takes the player to landscape 5 which explains the game rules in detail. The page also has a button in the left corner which says "main menu" which takes the player back to landscape 3. 

Button 3 (Saved games) takes the player to landscape 6 which holds a list of "saved games" of the user. This list will to a beginning be empty but will store a list of recorded games that the user has chosen to save. The saving process will take place at the end of a game (landscape 4) if the player would chose to save it by pressing the "save game button". The "save games" page (landscape 6) will also hold a "main menu" button to take the player back to the main menu (landscape 3).
The 4th and final button (exit) on the main menu (landscape 3) will simply exit the game.
