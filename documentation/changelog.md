## Week 3

- This week I went through three main versions of the architecture for my project with each iteration getting more simple and straight forward.
- Created tests that cover all of the functions apart from the main function which isn't ready for any meaningful testing.	


## Week 4

- This week I more or less completed all of the GameLogic class or in other words the main game. I also had to reiterate on some of the older functions. I also created tests for all functions. With 100% coverage on all the relevant parts.
