# Testing documentation

Here documentation about testing will be kept and updated during the development of this project.


## Coverage Rapport

### Updated 5.4.2022
As of this moment proper tests have been developed for classes: Card, CreateDeck, GameBoard and GameLogic. The current iteration of index.py is only a filler function to be used when automating testing and test rapporting with poetry invoke calls and thus there are no tests for it.
